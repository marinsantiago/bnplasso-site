# bnplasso ![bnplasso](reference/figures/bnplasso.png)

## Overview

The R package `bnplasso` (developer’s version) implements the
[Nonparametric Bayesian
Lasso](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2025.2572327) as described in
Marin et al. (2025+).

The main routine of the package,
[`bnplasso.lm()`](reference/bnplasso.lm.md), returns an object of S3
class, `"lmBayes"`, which is supported by various methods such as
[`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html),
[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html),
[`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html),
[`fitted()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/fitted.values.html),
[`residuals()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/residuals.html),
[`coef()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/coef.html), and
[`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html), allowing users to
quickly visualize, evaluate, and analyze the output in a familiar
fashion. The function [`bnplasso.lm()`](reference/bnplasso.lm.md) can
also implement the Bayesian Lasso (Park and Casella, 2008) and the
Bayesian adaptive Lasso (Leng et al., 2014).

## Installation

You can install the latest developer’s version via `pak` as:

``` r

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("marinsantiago/bnplasso")
```

If you would like to reproduce the results from Marin et al. (2025+),
you should install the version of the package employed at that time
(`bnplasso 0.1.0`). That can easily be done by running in R:

``` r

pak::pak("marinsantiago/bnplasso@3c87169")
```

Alternatively, you can also install the package (`bnplasso 0.1.0`) from
the `bnplasso` folder in the supplementary materials to Marin et
al. (2025+):

1.  In R, set your working directory to the folder `bnplasso`.

2.  Run the following R code:

``` r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::build()
devtools::install()
```

A detailed *changelog* is available
[here](https://marinsantiago.github.io/bnplasso-site/news/index.html).

## Usage

First, let’s start by loading some packages that are not required by
`bnplasso` but are necessary for this illustrative example.

``` r

library(mvtnorm)
```

Next, let’s generate some synthetic predictors.

``` r

p <- 200
rho <- 0.7
n.train <- 250
n.test <- 2000

set.seed(1)
Sigma.x <- rho^abs(matrix(1:p - 1, p, p, byrow = TRUE) - (1:p - 1))
X.train <- rmvnorm(n.train, rep(0, p), Sigma.x)
X.test <- rmvnorm(n.test, rep(0, p), Sigma.x)
```

Here, our training set is of size 250 (`n.train`), while our held-out
set is of size 2000 (`n.test`). The covariate space has 200 dimensions
(`p`), and each covariate vector is drawn from a multivariate normal
distribution with mean zero and an AR(1) covariance matrix, where the
correlation parameter is 0.7 (`rho`).

Now, we will generate the model parameters.

``` r

mu <- 10
sigma <- 1
beta <- c(rep(5, 20), rep(0, 180))
```

Here, the intercept term is equal to ten (`mu`), the residual standard
deviation is one (`sigma`), and the vector of regression coefficients is
generated in a way so that only 10% of its entries are nonzero (`beta`).

Finally, let’s generate the responses.

``` r

set.seed(1)
y.train <- as.vector(mu + X.train %*% beta + rnorm(n.train, 0, sigma))
y.test <- as.vector(mu + X.test %*% beta + rnorm(n.test, 0, sigma))
```

We can then easily apply the nonparametric Bayesian Lasso (Marin et al.,
2025+) to these data through the function
[`bnplasso.lm()`](reference/bnplasso.lm.md).

``` r

set.seed(1)
out.bnp <- bnplasso::bnplasso.lm(X.train, y.train)
```

Note that we are only supplying the design matrix and the response
vector. If some user-supplied hyperparameters are not provided, the
[`bnplasso.lm()`](reference/bnplasso.lm.md) function will attempt to
automatically determine appropriate values for those hyperparameters.
That being said, different applications may require different and more
tailored prior specifications.

The method [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) provides
information about the model fit.

``` r

summary(out.bnp)
```

    Call details:

    a = 0.1
    b = 4e-05
    alpha = 0.4014365
    n.obs = 250
    n.preds = 200
    n.draws = 5000 (after burn-in and thinning)
    elapsed = 10.58291 secs

    ⋮

It includes details about the function call, as well as the posterior
mean, posterior standard deviation, various posterior quantiles, and the
MCMC effective sample size for each of the model parameters.

The method [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html)
produces various model diagnostics plots, including posterior predictive
checks and residual diagnostics.

``` r

plot(out.bnp)
```

![](./reference/figures/Rplot1.png)![](./reference/figures/Rplot2.png)

![](./reference/figures/Rplot3.png)![](./reference/figures/Rplot4.png)

One can also extract the individual chains containing posterior draws
from each of the model parameters. For instance, let’s extract and plot
the chains for the `intercept`, `beta_1`, and `beta_200`.

``` r

plot(out.bnp$post.mu, type = "l", ylab = "", main = "mu")
plot(out.bnp$post.beta[,1], type = "l", ylab = "", main = "beta_1")
plot(out.bnp$post.beta[,200], type = "l", ylab = "", main = "beta_200")
```

![](./reference/figures/Rplot5.png)

![](./reference/figures/Rplot6.png)

![](./reference/figures/Rplot7.png)

Note that the chains are centered around the true parameter values and
exhibit good mixing!

Other useful class-specific methods include:

``` r

print(out.bnp)
fitted(out.bnp)
residuals(out.bnp)
coef(out.bnp)
```

We can also visualize the posterior co-clustering probabilities, i.e.,
the posterior probabilities that two regression coefficients will be
clustered together.

``` r

bnplasso::coclust.probs(out.bnp$post.clust_idx)
```

![](./reference/figures/Rplot8.png)

Note that the first 20 regression coefficients (which are nonzero) are
clustered together with large probability, while the remaining 180
(which are zero) are also clustered together with large probability. As
such, the nonparametric Bayesian Lasso is accurately performing variable
selection.

If desired, one can also obtain a point estimate of the partition of the
regression coefficients.

``` r

part <- bnplasso::get.partition(out.bnp$post.clust_idx)
```

By default, the function [`get.partition()`](reference/get.partition.md)
employs the variation of information loss function from Wade and
Ghahramani (2018); however, users can also employ the Binder loss
function. One can visualize this partition with the function
[`coclust.point()`](reference/coclust.point.md).

``` r

bnplasso::coclust.point(part)
```

![](./reference/figures/Rplot9.png)

It is also possible to perform out-of-sample predictions using the
method [`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html).

``` r

pprd <- predict(out.bnp, X.test)
```

``` r

dim(pprd)
```

    5000 2000

The result is a `matrix` of size `n.draws`-by-`n.test`, where each
column contains posterior predictive draws from each one of the points
we wish to predict.

``` r

plot(density(pprd[,1]), lwd = 3, xlab = "", ylab = "", "y_test.1")
abline(v = y.test[1], col = 2, lwd = 3, lty = 2)
legend("topright", c("Predicted", "Actual"), lwd = 3, col = 1:2, lty = 1:2)

plot(density(pprd[,2000]), lwd = 3, xlab = "", ylab = "", "y_test.2000")
abline(v = y.test[2000], col = 2, lwd = 3, lty = 2)
legend("topright", c("Predicted", "Actual"), lwd = 3, col = 1:2, lty = 1:2)
```

![](./reference/figures/Rplot10.png)![](./reference/figures/Rplot11.png)

For instance, the plots above show the posterior predictive distribution
along with the actual response values for the first and last points in
the held-out set.

Given a held-out set, one can evaluate the out-of-sample predictive
performance of the model using the expected log point-wise predictive
density (elppd) through the function [`elppd()`](reference/elppd.md).

``` r

bnplasso::elppd(out.bnp, X.test, y.test)
```

    -1.502845

If a held-out set is not available, one can estimate the model fit using
the functions [`psis.loo()`](reference/psis.loo.md) and
[`widely.aic()`](reference/widely.aic.md), which compute the
Pareto-smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out information criterion
(PSIS-LOO) and the Watanabe–Akaike information criterion (WAIC), as in
Vehtari et al. (2017).

``` r

bnplasso::psis.loo(out.bnp)
bnplasso::widely.aic(out.bnp)
```
